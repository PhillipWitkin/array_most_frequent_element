/*
Given an array of strings, 
find the one that appears most frequently and the number of times
it appears. 
If there are more than one element that occur that many times, 
pick any of them

Return the most repeated string s, 
and the number of times n it occurs,
as an array in the form [s, n]

/*
Example 1
Input: ["the", "dog", "jumped", "over", "the", "moon"]
Output: ["the", 2]

Explanation: The string "the" appears 2 times in the array, 
and every other element only appears once
